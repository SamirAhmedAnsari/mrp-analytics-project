# Improving MRP Forecast Accuracy Using Exception-Based Analytics


# Project Overview

This independent project demonstrates how simple analytics-driven oversight can significantly improve the effectiveness of Material Requirements Planning (MRP) in manufacturing environments. The project focuses on identifying hidden inefficiencies such as forecast instability, stockout risk, and exception-prone parts using structured data analysis.

# Purpose and Motivation

Many manufacturers rely heavily on ERP/MRP systems that function well under ideal assumptions but struggle when faced with real-world variability such as changing demand patterns, supplier delays, and constrained lead times. This project was created to illustrate how lightweight analytical techniques can reveal operational risks that may otherwise remain hidden in routine planning processes.

# Methodology

The project uses a simulated dataset representing typical manufacturing planning inputs, including forecast quantities, actual demand, lead times, safety stock, and on-hand inventory. Using Excel-based analysis, the following techniques were applied:

- Forecast variance analysis

- Stockout identification logic

- Exception-based flagging for high-risk parts

- Summary metrics to quantify overall planning stability

# Key Findings

Analysis of the dataset revealed:

- A meaningful portion of parts triggered exception flags, indicating instability in planning assumptions

- Stockouts occurred even under moderate forecast accuracy, highlighting sensitivity to lead time and safety stock settings

- Exception-based monitoring would allow planners to prioritize attention on high-impact items rather than manually reviewing all parts equally

# Broader Relevance

Although this project uses simulated data, the analytical concepts demonstrated here are broadly applicable to real-world manufacturing environments. Exception-based analytics can support improved decision-making, increased operational efficiency, reduced waste, and stronger supply chain reliability across a wide range of industries.
